# polaroid-generator
The HTML and CSS on this were no problem but figuring out the JavaScript component of the project was a little more difficult. I didn't do any work for making it responsive, as I figured it'd be a webapp solely. 

This web app captures a photo by fetching the current video and drawing it into a canvas then converting it into a PNG. Users can save the photo as well if they right click on the polaroid photo.
