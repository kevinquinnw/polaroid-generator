# Description 
This web app captures a photo by fetching the current video and drawing it into a canvas then converting it into a PNG. The app takes the photo and  manipulates it to look like a polaroid. Users can save the photo as well if they right click on the polaroid photo. 

# Instructions 
To take a photo all you have to do is let the application access your webcam and hit the blue button on the 'comeseekevin' camera. Then you will have a polaroid! To save the photo, just right click the photo and you will be able to download the original copy.  

# Built With
- HTML 
- CSS
- JS

# Overview
The HTML and CSS on this were no problem but figuring out the JavaScript component of the project was a little more difficult. I didn't do any work for making it responsive, as I figured it'd be a webapp solely.
